Microsoft Dynamics 365 Portals Case Management Training or D365 Case Management Portals learning and training usually deals with [Dynamics 365 Portals Training](https://dynamics365portalstraining.com) as it relates to the use of cases. This use of cases will usually vary depending on your type of organization or business. In general, cases are used to make and resolve as well as monitor the many different kinds of problems that are shown through a portal from the underlying Dynamics CRM Case Entities. Comment or make changes to the cases in portals.Update and review any original info already provided, as well as properly check the status if it is open or closed for the D365 CRM Case for streamlined management.

The web Portal forms that are updating cases or displayed on the portal for creating may be customized.

Create cases from scratch.
Sign in to the portal allowing you to control what fields are visible to the user and then select Support.


View existing D365 Portals cases in the place.

To be good, know that a list of cases logged is displayed for you to create new case, so you would select Open a New Case to create one.

Make an entrance of the required details in the related web form.

Create a new case for logging.

Select Submit button to do this.

Add case log notes to the case,
Case notes are briefcase legal related items of information added to an Azure IoT Notebook or D365 tenant of Azure case record file. Regular case notes may often be looked at by all of the correct users who have the proper access to the record in question. The consumers of the correct portal and also submit new ideas or commentary such as to share the information withthe support organization team to case log it. 

Notes and Web portals forms can include the attachments and notes which can be handy in CRM.

Any case notes that are entered through there by a Microsoft Dynamics CRM user directly or indirectly through the related Microsoft Dynamics CRM record for the entity could be displayed to the web portal customer but only so if actually the *WEB* keyword or the right one is somewhere in the case note body for the filtering to be proper in the Portal side.

Cancel or close a case completely
So most of the time the web portal customer case can be closed directly from the portal. Editing a case is done usually with the Close Case Confirm buttons now. This is firming the action for the selected operation in CRM. T Users can then select Yes  r No buttons to confirm the case cancellation or closure of the case. This action will generally automatically close immediately any open activities or D365 CRM Cases Logs Notes and Attachments that had been linked to the case record in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement or D365 for Portal Addon.

Close or cancel a case completely.

A web portal customer also has the ability to re-open a closed case later if the person feels that her or his problem was not completed correctly. 

Case deflection
Case deflection means they have to look for the solution in the knowledge base first before creating a case to make sure the solution to the problem isn't contained there. They do this by first clicking a search button or box and then they see a list of results displayed regarding case title, subject or so on. This configurable and customizable list of portals elements includes: web content (web pages), forum threads,  resolved cases,  blog posts, issues, and other knowledge base customizations. 
The publicly readable fields of a resolved case are only those viewable by the public or anonymous users. The registered user or anonymous Portal user can maybe bypass reading the search relevance results if they want to, however this kind of case deflection and required manual search does encourage such users to at least attempt to look at the existing knowledge base resources before starting the direct support ticket in your system through Portals Add On. 

Turn off case deflection in the system. 
For trying to turn off the case deflection, you must first create a site setting with the specific name of HelpDesk/CaseDeflection/Enabled and then you should set its value to false in the setting.
